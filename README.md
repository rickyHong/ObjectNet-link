What is ObjectNet?
A new kind of vision dataset borrowing the idea of controls from other areas of science.
No training set, only a test set! Put your vision system through its paces.
Collected to intentionally show objects from new viewpoints on new backgrounds.
50,000 image test set, same as ImageNet, with controls for rotation, background, and viewpoint.
313 object classes with 113 overlapping ImageNet
Large performance drop, what you can expect from vision systems in the real world!
Robust to fine-tuning and a very difficult transfer learning problem
